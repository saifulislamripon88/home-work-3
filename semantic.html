        <h2>THE BEST ARTICLE ON LOVE & RELATIONSHIPS THAT I‚ÄôVE EVER READ {AND THAT YOU NEED TO READ TOO}</h2>
        <br>
    
    
    <p>Every single time I‚Äôve read this article, I learn something new about myself, the way I show love, and those relationships close to me, so I‚Äôm incredibly excited to share it with you all in the hopes that you find as much inspiration {and dare I say, motivation?} from it as I do. We all know love is a constant ebb and flow of emotions, and even the strongest, healthiest relationships need help & advice sometimes. I have found ways to relate to Mark‚Äôs words in numerous ways ‚Äì from his analogies to his real-life examples from readers, his article is raw and real, and just the reminder we all need sometimes.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Well, it‚Äôs Valentine‚Äôs Day and what better time to share with you one of the most influential articles I‚Äôve ever read about love & relationships. Mark Manson, our author, decided to poll his own blog audience for advice in the week leading up to his own wedding. To borrow from Mark, ‚ÄúI sent out the call the week before my wedding: anyone who has been married for 10+ years and is still happy in their relationship, what lessons would you pass down to others if you could? What is working for you and your partner? And if you are divorced, what didn‚Äôt work previously?‚Äù This article was pulled from the overwhelming response Mark received from almost 1,500 people from around the world. The reasons why are not only insightful, but downright relatable to any person in any sort of relationship.</p>
